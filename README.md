# Welcome to Trent Evans' Portfolio
<p>
Hi!  Thanks for coming to check out my work.  I've really enjoyed being able to put all of this together.

<p>
I have an exciting list of projects that you can check out.  Feel free to take a look.  I'm doing my best
to try and include writeups for each project in the project folder, though some writeups may still be under
construction.  If they are, feel free to peruse the code and reach out to me if you have any questions.
